                            The research community has recently shown significant interest in designing automated systems to detect coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
                             using deep learning approaches and chest radiography images.<span id="dots">...</span> 
                            <span id="more">However, state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), demand more learnable parameters and memory. Therefore, they may not be suitable for real-time diagnosis. Thus, the design of a lightweight CNN model for fast and accurate COVID-19 detection is an urgent need. In this paper, a lightweight CNN model called LW-CORONet is proposed that comprises a sequence of convolution, rectified linear unit (ReLU), and pooling layers followed by two fully connected layers. The proposed model facilitates extracting meaningful features from the chest X-ray (CXR) images with only five learnable layers. The proposed model is evaluated using two larger CXR datasets (Dataset-1: 2250 images and Dataset-2: 15,999 images) and the classification accuracy obtained are 98.67% and 99.00% on Dataset-1 and 95.67% and 96.25% on Dataset-2 for multi-class and binary classification cases, respectively. The results are compared with four contemporary pre-trained CNN models as well as state-of-the-art models. The effect of several hyperparameters: different optimization techniques, batch size, and learning rate have also been investigated. 
                            The proposed model demands fewer parameters and requires less memory space.
                             Hence, it is effective for COVID-19 detection and c

                            The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe healthcare crises across the globe in a very short period. 
                            The pandemic broke out in early December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and was declared a global pandemic on 11th March 2020 by the World 
                            Health Organization (WHO) [1]. <span id="dots">...</span>
                            <span id="more"> Researchers across the world have reported COVID-19 to be a highly infectious disease that severely affects the respiratory system and has common symptoms like dry cough, myalgia, fever, headache, chest pain, and sore throat [2]. The current medical diagnostic processes lack proper medicine and drugs as well as hospital resources for the treatment of COVID-19 infection [3,4]. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a manual, time-consuming, and costly tool, is the most frequently used diagnostic method for detection which causes the risk to medical staff [5,6]. It is still an ongoing pandemic and has led to various variants, thereby, resulting in high mortality rates in many countries. Hence, there is a strong need for a safe and effective methodology that can detect COVID-19 infection at an early stage. The significance of two imaging modalities such as chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) has been studied for diagnosing COVID-19 [7,8,9]. However, manual visual inspection of both CXR and CT images is time-taking and tedious which may sometimes result in an inaccurate diagnosis [7,10]. Recently, tremendous efforts have been made in developing artificial intelligence
                             (AI) based automated models for accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 to lessen the workload of radiologists [11].

Hemdan et al. [18] proposed COVIDX-Net for binary classification task which was validated using only 50 CXR images. Narin et al.

Ucar and Korkmaz [20] presented a multi-class classification system based on SqueezeNet and Bayesian optimizer that yielded an accuracy of 98.3%. Rahimzadeh and Attar [21] designed a model that concatenates Xception and ResNet50 networks and yields 91.4% accuracy for multi-class cases. Wang et al. [22] developed a tailored deep CNN model using CXR images that achieved an accuracy of 93.3%. Toğaçar et al. [23] achieved a classification accuracy of 97.06% using fuzzy color, stacking approach, and two DL approaches such as MobileNetV2 and SqueezeNet. Toraman et al. [24] proposed a convolutional CapsNet model to detect COVID-19 using CXR images and achieved an accuracy of 84.22% for multi-class classification cases. Han et al. [25] developed a deep 3D multiple instance learning methodology using chest CT images and obtained an accuracy of 94.3% on a three-class classification task. Zhang et al. [26] proposed a 7-layer-based CNN with stochastic pooling to detect COVID-19 from CT images. Wang et al. [27] developed a novel CCSHNet system for COVID-19 classification where two best pre-trained CNN models were selected to learn features and a discriminant correlation analysis method was used to fuse those features. Chaudhary and Pachori [28] used pretrained CNN models over the sub-band images generated from ourier-Bessel series expansion-based decomposition (FBSE) for COVID-19 detection. Joshi et al. [29] designed a multi-scale CNN for effective COVID-19 diagnosis from CT images. Recently, Bhattacharyya et al. [30] employed the VGG-19 model with the binary robust invariant scalable key points (BRISK) to detect COVID-19 cases from X-ray images. Jyoti et al. [31] proposed an automated COVID-19 detection 
                            method using memristive crossbar array-based tunable Q-wavelet transform (TQWT) and ResNet-50.

                            <span id="more">The most frequently used DL models require a lot of training parameters and memory. 
                             The design of a lightweight DL method thus assumes significant urgency. Moreover, the performance of DL models relies on several hyperparameters: learning rate, batch size, type of optimizer, and the number of epochs, etc. However, there are only a limited number of studies on these parameters.
                             Hence, there exists ample scope to conduct an investigation that includes an in-depth analysis of different hyperparameters to obtain the best possible results for COVID-19 detection. In a recent study [32], the COVID-19 classification performance was evaluated using eight pre-trained CNN models over a small dataset. All those models required a huge number of parameters. The performance of these models was evaluated for only binary classification scenarios. Nonetheless, despite being very challenging, a multi-class classification is in high demand.

                            The first dataset (Dataset-1) considered in our study comprises CXR images of three classes: Normal, COVID-19, and pneumonia that were collected from Figshare repository https://figshare.com/articles/COVID-19_Chest_X-RayImage_Repository/12580328, accessed on 21 November 2022 [37]. The quantity of available radiography images of COVID-19 patients is still limited. In addition, data imbalance has remained a major concern. Therefore, a total of 2250 CXR samples were collected for the three classes with 750 samples in each class. Dataset-1 mainly considered the COVID-19 cases from several open sources which are updated periodically.
                            To further verify the efficacy of the proposed model, we considered another dataset COVIDx-V7A (termed as Dataset-2 in this study) which comprises 15,999 CXR images from 15,122 patients across 51 countries and is the largest open-access dataset available to date [22]. These images were collected from five different data repositories and are available at https://github.com/lindawangg/COVID-Net, accessed on 21 November 2022. Table 1 shows the detailed specification of the considered datasets. The samples of a few frontal-view CXR images of different classes from Dataset-1 are presented in Figure 1.
